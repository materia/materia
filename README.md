Materia
======

Materia is a code-based user interface library for PHP.

In many web applications, the norm is to use HTML templates (Twig, Smarty, etc) for views.

This project is eliminating templates in favor of code constructing the views.
This will allow you to work with the UI from your code, giving you much more 
control over how you'll be structuring your code. It makes it much easier to 
change navigation and overall layouts later in the project.

Take a look at the `example/` directory to see how it's used.

## Trying the example:

```
git clone git@github.com:materia/materia.git
cd materia
composer install
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 example/example1.php
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
